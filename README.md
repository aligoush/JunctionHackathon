# JunctionHackathon
This is the solution to one of Junction Malaga's proposed challenges. <br>
The challenge was to improve the customer experience in shopping malls. Our proposal is to make a photo booth with an Artificial Intelligence filter applied depending on the theme (Halloween, movie promotion). <br>
Apart from that, we wanted to give an additional value to the malls by collecting data through the tickets. Customers take a photo of these tickets and if they accumulate a certain amount, they get a reward: a Polaroid photo. <br>
The tickets are processed thanks to an API (Mindee) with artificial intelligence and the relevant data for shopping malls is extracted.
